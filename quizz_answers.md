You need a robust vulnerability management program to complement your other security operations and risk management initiatives. Periodic reviews and rigorous modeling should be in order! Whether you have a small, large, or huge security budget with all the possible tools at your disposal, you are up against continuous and persistent threats with bigger resources and unlimited time.

Sooo… you need to breathe, relax, and implement a robust vulnerability/asset/patch management program like a year ago. Not to worry - they say Time is a relative concept and that “happy hour is always somewhere”!
