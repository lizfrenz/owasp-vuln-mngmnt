#### If your total is less or equal 9.9

You need a robust vulnerability management program regardless the size of your organization. Even though you do not have a security team yet, you can insource this responsibility to the cyber security enthusiast in your company. Yearly scans satisfy yesterday’s compliance requirements. Delivering compliance checks alone, doesn’t protect the future of your [business](https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches). 

#### If your total is less or equal 15

You need a robust vulnerability management program to complement your other security operations and risk management initiatives. Periodic reviews and rigorous modeling should be in order! Whether you have a small, large, or huge security budget with all the tools possible at your disposal, you are up against continuous and persistent threats with bigger resources and unlimited time.

#### If your total is more than 15

Sooo… you need to breathe, relax, and implement a robust vulnerability/asset/patch management program like a year ago. Not to worry, they say Time is a relative concept and “there is a happy hour somewhere”!
